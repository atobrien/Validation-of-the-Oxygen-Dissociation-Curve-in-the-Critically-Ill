# Validation-of-the-Oxygen-Dissociation-Curve-in-the-Critically-Ill

# ABSTRACT

## Background: 
The oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve (ODC) is frequently used in decision making in the intensive care unit (ICU). Historical models of the ODC’s shape are derived from small populations (approximately 10 individuals) and non-human surrogates.  However, to date there is no large-scale validation of the ODC shape properties in the critically ill population. 

## Objective:  
To validate the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve shape in the critically ill. 

## Methods: 
This is a retrospective, multi-center cohort study leveraging information within the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database and the eICU Collaborative Research database. We constructed a generalized additive cubic spline smoothed curve of critically ill patients’ oxygen saturation to oxygen partial pressure to visualize the ODC. The ODC was then validated against predicted modeled curves using Adair, Kellman and Severinghaus’ equations which adjust for temperature, pH and acid base status. Cumulative density function curves and two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests were used to statistically compare the patients’ oxygen saturation values with the modeled data. Furthermore, we drew 1000 samples of the patient data and modeled data, ran 10,000 Monte Carlo permutations to plot simulated data normalized distributions under central limit theory, and computed Welch’s t-test to statistically compare the simulated distributions’ means. 

## Results: 
The smoothed ODC of the MIMIC III and eICU cohort of critically ill patients closely mimics the modeled curves described by Adair, Kellman, and Severinghaus. Although the cumulative density functions were statistically different, the clinical relevance of the difference is questionable. 

## Conclusions:
Our study validates that on average the shape of the ODC in the critically ill is sigmoidal as described by Adair, Kellman, and Severinghaus.
